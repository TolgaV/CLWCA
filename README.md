# CLWCA
Purpose of this Bash script is to create a new /etc/network/interfaces document for connecting to new networks. Every time its executed it writes on /etc/network/interfaces and creates a document of visible SSID's around to where you are at that moment. This is just a prototype and for sure it can be and it will be improved.
I have written this since I couldn't find anything like this myself in the web, if you can, don't hesitate to share because there are people looking for this kind of ease.
